**Summary**

In the hospitality industry, handling advance reservations is a crucial factor. The consumer has the contractual guarantee of hotel service at a predetermined price, as well as the option to cancel, when reservations are negotiated. When a guest cancels a reservation, however, the resulting empty rooms are crucial to the business because they incur expenses and miss out on business opportunities. From 2014 to 2018, the European cancellation rate increased from 33% to 40% based on the value of the reservation. Hotel chain C must address the high cancellation rate of hotel H2, so it will provide data for a business consultant to conduct an in-depth analysis of this issue.
